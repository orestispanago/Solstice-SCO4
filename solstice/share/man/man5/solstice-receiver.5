.SH "NAME"
solstice-receiver \- declare the solar\-plant receivers for solstice(1)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBsolstice\-receiver\fR format is used by \fBsolstice\fR(1) to declare which geometric entities defined in a \fBsolstice\-input\fR(5) file are receivers\&. For each receiver, \fBsolstice\fR(1) computes its overall intercepted power, its associated losses as well as its efficiency\&. Refer to the \fBsolstice\-output\fR(5) format for informations on the per receiver data generated by \fBsolstice\fR(1)\&. Declaring the receivers separately of the solar plant, allows to use the same \fBsolstice\-input\fR(5) file for several simulations using different receivers\&. For instance, one can define a specific \fBsolstice\-receiver\fR file that declares some primary reflectors as receivers in order to track an unforeseen comportment observed during a previous simulation\&.
.sp
The \fBsolstice\-receiver\fR format uses the YAML 1\&.1 data serialization standard [1]; assuming that the file is compatible with the \fBsolstice\-receiver\fR semantic, the YAML compact notation can thus be used\&.
.sp
A receiver is identified by its \fBname\fR that must be a valid \fBentity\-identifier\fR as defined in the \fBsolstice\-input\fR(5) format\&. This identifier must reference a geometric entity and not a pivot or an empty entity\&. The side of the geometry that is tracked is defined by the \fBside\fR attribute of the receiver\&. Note that the front and the back side of a geometry can be both considered if the \fBside\fR attribute is set to \fBFRONT_AND_BACK\fR\&. Refer to the \fBsolstice\-input\fR(5) specification for informations on which side of the geometry is front facing or back facing\&. Finally, if the optional \fBper_primitive\fR flag is set, \fBsolstice\fR(1) will estimate the irradiance for each triangle of the receiver and use these data to generate a receiver map as described in \fBsolstice\-output\fR(5)\&. The \fBper\-primitive\fR flag can be set to \fBINCOMING\fR, \fBABSORBED\fR or \fBINCOMING_AND_ABSORBED\fR to produce the incoming flux density map, the absorbed flux density map, or both\&.

Define that the front and back side of the entity \fBsmall_square\fR are receivers\&. For each side, enable the computation of per triangle absorbed irradiance\&.
.sp

\- name: small_square

.sp
Declare that the front side of 3 reflectors are receivers\&. Use the YAML compact notation to reduce the number of lines:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\- {name: H1\&.heliostat\&.reflector, side: FRONT}

.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
Declare that the back side of \fBreceiver\fR is effectively a receiver and enable the estimation of its associated incoming irradiance map\&. Make a receiver from the front side of the reflector named \fBLFR0\&.pivot\&.reflector\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
\- {name: receiver, side: BACK, per_primitive: INCOMING}
